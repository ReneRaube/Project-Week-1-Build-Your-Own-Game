## Project Description
I chose this game, because it is straight-forward, i.e. everybody can play it and it is a fun game with a good chance of winning if you chose rationally.

## Rules
You've got 8 times to guess a random number between 1 and 100. It is indicated after every try if the hidden number is higher or lower than the chosen value.

## Workflow
Firstly, I describe the game to the reader. One has to take the persepctive of those who play the game. 
After letting the computer choose randomly, I let the player make his/her first guess. In case (most likely) that the
right number hasn't been found after the first guess, it is indicated if the hidden number is higher of lower than the value that the player chose. This step is repeated until either the player identified the correct number or 8 rounds passed.
In the end it is stated if the player won or lost.

## Organization
I followed the outlined steps in Trello.
My repository is separated into a README-file (the one you've just opened), a gitignore-file, the presentation and the game-code itself.
